                <p>Waterfall model</p>
                <span>Waterfall model is the simplest model Software Development Life Cycle.
                    All the phases of SDLC will function in linear line one after another.
                     When the first phase is finished then only the second phase and start and so on.
                      The sequential nature of model does not allow us to go back and undo or redo the our actions. 
                      It does not work smoothly if there are some issues left at the previous step. 
                   This model is best suited when developers already have designed and developed similar software in the past and are aware of all its domain.
                    It provides structure to inexperienced staff. Works well when quality is more important then cost or schedule.</span>

                        <span>Developers build a prototype during the requirements phase.<br>
                            Prototype is evaluated by end users. <br>
                            Users give corrective feedback. Developers further develop the prototype. <br>
                            When the user is satisfied , the prototype code is brought up to standards needed for a final product.Some of the steps, which are followed by Structured Evolutionary Prototyping Steps :<br> <br>
                            1)A Preliminary project plan is developed<br>
                            2) Partial high-level paper based model is created.<br>
                            3)The model is source for a partial requirements specification<br>
                            4)A prototype is built with basic and critical attributes<br>
                            5)The designer builds : The database, User interface and Algorithmic Functions<br>
                            6) The designer demonstrates the prototype, the user evaluates for problems and suggests improvements.<br>
                            7) This loop continues until the user is satisfied with the product.</span>

                                        <span>RAD is a software development methodology that focuses on building applications in a very short amount of time.
                                            It is a high speed adaption of the linear sequential model in which rapid development is achieved by using component based
                                             construction .It improved productivity with fewer people means lower costs.
                                              It minimizes the risk of not achieving business needs and customer satisfaction.
                                               It requires sufficient human resources to create the team for development.
                                                Everybody must be committed to complete the process in the time frame.</span>

                                                    In the first phase, this model considers risk, which often goes un noticed by most other models. <br>
                                                    In the Second phase, The model starts with constraints of the software at the starting of the iteration.<br> 
                                                    In the third phase is of the prototyping the software. This phase includes risk management.<br> 
                                                    In the last phase of the plan of next iteration is prepared.  The model is complex.</span>

                                                               Later, when the product is developed and is ready for testing, test cases of this stage verify the software agains

           <p><center>Among the many SDLC methodologies, those that fall under the Agile classification are generally better. Among the Agile SDLC methods, I have a few suggestions:
            First, we should focus on SDLC methodologies that enhance flexibility, collaboration, and speed of software delivery.
            In this case, I believe <b>Scrum, Feature-Driven Development, and Extreme Programming (XP)</b> are better options compared to others.<br><br> </center></p>

                        <p>Scrum Model</p>
                        <span>Scrum's iterative and incremental approach breaks the project up into manageable, small units called sprints, which usually span two to four weeks. This makes it possible for teams to consistently deliver functioning product increments, facilitating prompt feedback and modifications.
                            Improved Collaboration: Through sprint planning, daily stand-up meetings, and retrospectives, Scrum places a strong emphasis on cooperation and teamwork. Development work is divided into "Packets".This promotes communication between stakeholders and team members, guaranteeing that everyone is on the same track about goals and achievements.
                            Flexibility: Even at the very end of the development process, Scrum permits requirements to alter. In dynamic workplaces where user needs may change, this flexibility is essential.
                            Emphasis on Deliverables: By placing a strong emphasis on generating a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint, the team is guaranteed to stay committed to providing value to the client.</span>

                                <p>Feature-Driven Development (FDD)</p>
                                <span>Feature-Centric Approach: FDD prioritizes the methodical delivery of concrete, functional features. By organizing and controlling tasks according to client needs, this method assists teams in making sure that the most useful features are created first.
                                    Clear and Structured Process: FDD offers an organized framework that includes roles, duties, and procedures. Teams that use this structure are better able to stay accountable and focused while remaining adaptable to changes.
                                    Frequent work Tracking: FDD places an extreme value on using feature lists and status updates to monitor work on a regular basis. Stakeholders are able to see the development process and make well-informed judgments since there is transparency.
                                    
                                    Cooperation with Stakeholders: To guarantee that the finished product meets user expectations, FDD pushes cooperation with stakeholders throughout the feature definition and design stages.

                                        <p>Extreme Programming (XP)</p>
                                        <span>Focus on Technical Excellence: XP encourages the use of best practices in software development, including pair programming, continuous integration, and test-driven development (TDD). Reliable software is delivered more quickly thanks to these techniques, which also improve code quality and decrease errors.
                                            client Involvement: Throughout the development process, XP promotes ongoing client input and participation. The product's ability to adjust to evolving requirements and satisfy user needs is guaranteed by this close partnership.
                                            Regular Releases: XP promotes regular releases of tiny functional increments so that teams may promptly collect feedback and make the required corrections. This quick delivery cycle improves user response.

                                               <p> I developed a thorough understanding of basic computer and programming principles during this training.
                                                 I started off by providing an overview of data, information, and computer hardware before delving into the compilation or interpretation processes used by high-level programming languages (HLPL).
                                                  I gained an understanding of the importance of variables, data types, and fundamental operations by using them in straightforward input-output programs.
                                                   As I worked with arrays, functions, and pointers, the course focused on software development approaches like Agile and Waterfall. 
                                                   I also studied file management, string manipulation with regular expressions, and user-defined data structures (structs). 
                                                   I learned effective data storage and retrieval techniques from data structures including queues, stacks, and linked lists. 
                                                   I used key ideas like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation that were introduced by object-oriented programming (OOP) to create Python programs. Lastly,
                                                    I improved my knowledge of database administration by creating web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in addition to fundamental SQL procedures.
                                                     My abilities were strengthened by the capstone project, which turned concepts I had learnt into a useful application. 
                                                My coding and problem-solving skills grew during my adventure, ready me for increasingly difficult tasks.</p>
